# CEREBRAL ARTERIES SEGMENTATION TO GUIDE ENDOVASCULAR TREATMENT OF ISCHEMIC STROKE

*Pilotto Loris* - 2020

**École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne - Data Science semester project**


This project has been offered by the [MIP:lab](https://miplab.epfl.ch/) and has been supervised by Dr. Maria Giulia Preti and Dr. Hofmeister Jérémy.

Based on 5 CT scans and their corresponding masks, different U-Net models have been trained for cerebral arteries segmentation.
